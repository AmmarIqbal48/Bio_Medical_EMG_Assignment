# Bio_Medical_EMG_Assignment

Goal of the assignment: learning the basis of EMG pre-processing

Description of the assignment:
-	Filter (band pass 30-450 Hz) advise FIR filter, recover phase delay 2 with ‘filtfilt’.
-	Rectify
-	Compute the envelope of the muscle signals (low pass 3-6 Hz)
-	now (Question A -why now?) you can down-sample the signal.

Question B- When does the muscle activation starts with respect to the movement (see motion signal)?

What should you send us (upload on teams)?

The Matlab code (with comments) that generates the following figures (better if 1 it is ONLY 1 figure with 3 panels):
-	EMG raw signal with on top the filtered signal plotted with a different color.
-	EMG rectified with on top the Envelope plotted with a different color.
-	The movement signals with on top the envelope (+ answer to question A and B)

You can (not a must) use the live scripts (upload the code and print a pdf).
